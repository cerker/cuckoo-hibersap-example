This is an example project for a Java EE application using Hibersap
and the Cuckoo Resource Adapter for SAP. The application implements
a search for customers from the Flight Booking demo application in
SAP where the data of individual customers can be changed.

The project shows how easy it is to call SAP functions from within
EJBs making use of Container Managed Transactions. It calls function
module BAPI_FLCUST_GETLIST to search customers and BAPI_FLCUST_CHANGE
to change the customer data.

The application uses the HibersapSessionInterceptor on an EJB to
directly inject a Hibersap Session. The Interceptor will take care of
correctly opening and closing the Session.

A Singleton EJB is used to configure Hibersap, create a SessionManager
and bind it to JNDI.
